"""" You are a loyal customer, and a store is offering discounts to their loyal customers:

For a purchase between 0 & 50 CAD, you get a 10 % discount.
For a purchase between 51 & 100 CAD, you get a 20 % discount.
For a purchase of more than 100 CAD, you get a 40 % discount.
On Monday, if you spend more than 50 CAD, you get an additional 10 CAD OFF.
In this task, you need to write a function to calculate how much the customerâ€™s purchase will actually cost after discounts and return that value."""
